# 👋 Hi, I'm Anup Chapain  

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I’m passionate about **Cloud Infrastructure, Python, Linux, networking, server administration, and automation**, and I’m continuously learning by building small but meaningful projects.
This is my documentation of learning towards my long term career goal of becoming a dependable DevOps engineer who is not completely replacable by AI very soon. ;)

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Linux fundamentals, shell scripting, and server management  
- Docker & containerization (currently experimenting with self-contained apps)  
- Networking tools, DNS diagnostics, and troubleshooting  
- Git/GitHub workflows for real-world projects

- GPU-accelerated with PyTorch + CUDA  
- Falls back to CPU gracefully  
- Potential application in privacy tools & compliance  

### 🔹 [Always-On DNS Tracker](https://github.com/fitandfine/linux-scripting-repo/blob/main/scripts/dns_tracker.sh)
> Bash script to monitor DNS queries with **live logging**, auto-start at boot, and silent background mode.  
- Uses colored real-time output for clarity  
- Helps with **network diagnostics** and security monitoring  

### 🔹 [Interactive Dictionary App](https://github.com/fitandfine/dictionary)
> JavaScript-based dictionary app that responds to **double-click word lookups**.  
- Handles punctuation gracefully  
- Great for quick learning & productivity  

### 🔹 [Dockerized Roster Builder](https://github.com/fitandfine/BP_Roster)
> Notes and scripts to set up first docker container.  
- Written in Python  
- Useful as a **self-study guide** for Docker

### 🔹 [DNS Inspector Pro - GUI](https://github.com/fitandfine/dnsinspect)
> Inspect all major DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, SOA, TXT, CAA.
- Written in Python ( Tkinter, dnspython , filedialog & messagebox )
